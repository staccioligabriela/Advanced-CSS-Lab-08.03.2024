## Design Recreation with CSS/SASS and Design Systems

In this activity, you will embark on the task of recreating a design in both desktop and mobile formats, which we have designed in Figma. To ensure the success of the activity, you will need to replicate this same design using CSS/SASS first, then Bootstrap 3, and finally Material Design. This means you have to finish with three different folders, each containing the design implemented in one of the specified methods.
First, analyze carefully the provided design in Figma and try to recreate it with as much detail as possible. Observe how the design is structured in terms of its layout for both the desktop and mobile versions. 

Steps you should follow:
1. Use CSS/SASS to faithfully reproduce the provided design. (Make sure to adhere to best practices and organize your code in a readable and easily maintainable manner.)
2. Use Bootstrap to faithfully reproduce the provided design.  Take advantage of the classes and components offered by Bootstrap to achieve the most accurate representation possible of the original design. 
3. Use Material design to faithfully reproduce the provided design. Consult the classes and components provided by Material Design to achieve the most accurate representation possible of the original design. 
4. Observe and analyze the differences and similarities in appearance and behavior between the implementations done with pure CSS/SASS, Bootstrap, and Material Design. 

*Tips!* Check the libraries provided by Bootstrap and Material Design to familiarize yourself with the process. Use the documentation and resources available on the official websites of Bootstrap and Material Design to better understand how to implement the necessary components and styles in your design.
